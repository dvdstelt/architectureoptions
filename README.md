# Changing your architecture during deployment

## ViewModel composition

[This demo](https://github.com/dvdstelt/architectureoptions/tree/main/src/CompositionGateway) shows how to gather data from multiple services to present it in the user interface, without any component knowing more than it should be. There is no all-knowing gateway that knows about all data and where to get it from.

## Priority Queues

[This demo](https://github.com/dvdstelt/architectureoptions/tree/main/src/PriorityQueues) wasn't used in the presentation due to time constraints. But it's explained in detail on my weblog in a series of articles [that starts here](https://bloggingabout.net/2020/07/16/priority-queues-why-you-dont-need-them/).
